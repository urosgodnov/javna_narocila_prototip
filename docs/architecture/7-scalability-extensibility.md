# 7. Scalability & Extensibility

- **Abstracted persistence layer** allows swapping SQLite for a full RDBMS.
- **ChromaDB client** abstraction for migrating vector stores.
- **Modular design**: each service is in its own Python module, facilitating future extraction.
- **Logging hooks** added to each service for tracing and monitoring.
