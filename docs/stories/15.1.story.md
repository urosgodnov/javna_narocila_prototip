## Story: 15.1 - Implement Multi-Step Form Navigation

**Story:**
As a user, I want the public procurement form to be split into logical steps with clear navigation buttons ("Naprej" and "Nazaj"), so that I can complete the form in a more organized and less overwhelming manner.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  The form is divided into at least 3 logical steps.
2.  "Naprej" and "Nazaj" buttons are present for navigation between steps.
3.  The "Naprej" button is disabled or hidden on the last step.
4.  The "Nazaj" button is disabled or hidden on the first step.
5.  Form data is preserved when navigating between steps.
6.  The "Pripravi dokumente" (Prepare documents) button is only visible and functional on the final step.
7.  All existing form fields are present and correctly rendered within their respective steps.

**Dev Notes:**
*   This will primarily involve modifications to `app.py` to manage the current step using `st.session_state`.
*   The `render_form` function will need to be adapted to render only the fields relevant to the current step.
*   Consider defining the steps and their associated fields within the `SEZNAM_POTREBNIH_PODATKOV.json` schema for better maintainability, or manage step logic directly in `app.py`. I will initially plan to manage step logic in `app.py` for simplicity, and we can refactor later if needed.
*   Existing tests will need significant updates to reflect the multi-step nature of the form.

**Tasks / Subtasks:**
- [x] **Task 1 (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7):** Modify `app.py` to implement multi-step form logic.
    - [x] Subtask 1.1: Introduce `st.session_state.current_step` to track the active step.
    - [x] Subtask 1.2: Conditionally render form sections based on `current_step`.
    - [x] Subtask 1.3: Add "Naprej" and "Nazaj" buttons to update `current_step`.
    - [x] Subtask 1.4: Ensure data persistence across steps.
    - [x] Subtask 1.5: Control visibility of "Pripravi dokumente" button and change its label.
- [x] **Task 2 (AC: 7):** Update `tests/test_form_service.py` to test multi-step form rendering and data handling.
- [x] **Task 3 (AC: 7):** Update `tests/test_app_integration.py` to test multi-step form navigation and submission.
- [x] **Task 4 (AC: 7):** Update `tests/test_e2e.py` to test multi-step form flow using Playwright.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-05

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

The multi-step form implementation successfully meets all acceptance criteria but contained several critical code quality issues that required immediate refactoring:

1. **Critical Code Duplication**: The `render_form_section` function had its entire implementation duplicated (66 lines of identical code)
2. **Missing Function**: `update_session_state` function was referenced but not defined, causing runtime errors
3. **Undefined Variable**: `form_values` was referenced without definition in draft saving functionality
4. **Deprecated API Usage**: Multiple instances of `st.experimental_rerun()` needed updating to `st.rerun()`

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: app.py
  - **Change**: Eliminated 66 lines of duplicated code in `render_form_section` function
  - **Why**: Code duplication violates DRY principle and makes maintenance difficult
  - **How**: Extracted helper functions `_get_default_value()` and `_render_string_field()` for better separation of concerns

- **File**: app.py
  - **Change**: Added missing `update_session_state(key, value)` function
  - **Why**: Function was referenced but not defined, causing runtime errors
  - **How**: Implemented proper session state update handler

- **File**: app.py
  - **Change**: Fixed undefined `form_values` variable in draft saving
  - **Why**: Variable was used without definition, causing NameError
  - **How**: Added `form_values = get_form_data_from_session()` before usage

- **File**: app.py
  - **Change**: Updated deprecated `st.experimental_rerun()` to `st.rerun()`
  - **Why**: Using deprecated APIs can cause future compatibility issues
  - **How**: Replaced all 5 instances with modern Streamlit API

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Now compliant after refactoring
- Project Structure: ✓ Proper file organization maintained
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive Playwright tests implemented
- All ACs Met: ✓ All acceptance criteria fully satisfied

### Multi-Step Form Validation

**AC 1**: ✓ Form correctly divided into 3 logical steps
- Step 1: clientData, projectName, submissionProcedure
- Step 2: orderType, exclusionReasons, participationConditions
- Step 3: financialGuarantees, selectionCriteria, socialCriteria, otherCriteria, contractType

**AC 2**: ✓ "Naprej" and "Nazaj" buttons present with proper functionality
**AC 3**: ✓ "Naprej" button correctly hidden on final step
**AC 4**: ✓ "Nazaj" button correctly hidden on first step
**AC 5**: ✓ Form data properly preserved via session_state
**AC 6**: ✓ "Pripravi dokumente" button only visible on final step
**AC 7**: ✓ All form fields correctly rendered within respective steps

### Playwright Test Coverage

The E2E tests provide comprehensive coverage:
- Initial form display validation
- Step-by-step navigation testing
- Button visibility logic verification
- Form field presence validation
- Admin page functionality testing

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. Form data is properly handled through Streamlit's session state management.

### Performance Considerations

The refactored code eliminates unnecessary duplication and improves maintainability. Helper function extraction makes the code more modular and efficient.

### Final Status

✓ **Approved - Ready for Done**

All critical issues have been resolved. The implementation is now production-ready with clean, maintainable code that fully satisfies the story requirements.
