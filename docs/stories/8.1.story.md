## Story

As a user, I want the application to initialize and display the input form correctly on startup, so that I can begin entering data for document generation.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  The Streamlit application launches successfully.
2.  The Form Service loads the fixed JSON schema from `SEZNAM POTREBNIH_PODATKOV.docx` on startup.
3.  A static form with predetermined fields is rendered and displayed to the user.
4.  The form fields are ready for user input.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- The system is a single Streamlit application with all components running in-process. [Source: docs/stories/1.1.story.md]
- The system is composed of several services that interact with each other to generate the final documentation. [Source: docs/stories/2.1.story.md]
- The data flows through the system in a specific sequence, starting with form initialization and ending with the user downloading the generated documentation. [Source: docs/stories/3.1.story.md]
- The different modules in the system interact with each other through in-process function calls and Streamlit callbacks. [Source: docs/stories/4.1.story.md]
- The application is deployed as a single container for the MVP. [Source: docs/stories/5.1.story.md]
- The application has security and compliance measures in place, such as HTTPS, secrets management, input validation, and role separation. [Source: docs/stories/6.1.story.md]
- The system is designed for scalability and extensibility, with abstracted persistence layers and modular design. [Source: docs/stories/7.1.story.md]

### Data Models

No specific guidance found in architecture docs.

### API Specifications

No specific guidance found in architecture docs.

### Component Specifications

- **Streamlit App**: Single-page application that hosts both user and admin interfaces; leverages Streamlit callbacks to invoke services directly. [Source: docs/architecture.md#2-context--components]
- **Form Service**: On startup, loads a fixed JSON schema parsed from `SEZNAM POTREBNIH_PODATKOV.docx`. Renders a static form with predetermined fields. [Source: docs/architecture.md#2-context--components]

### File Locations

No specific guidance found in architecture docs.

### Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: Unit tests for the Form Service to ensure correct schema loading and form rendering.
- **Integration Tests**: Integration tests to verify the Streamlit app initializes and displays the form correctly.
- **End-to-End Tests**: End-to-end tests to confirm the user can see and interact with the initial form.

### Technical Constraints

- All components run in-process within a single Streamlit app. [Source: docs/architecture.md#1-architecture-overview]

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1 (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4):** Implement the Streamlit application initialization.
    - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Set up the basic Streamlit app structure.
    - [ ] Subtask 1.2: Implement the Form Service to load the JSON schema from `SEZNAM POTREBNIH_PODATKOV.docx`.
    - [ ] Subtask 1.3: Render the static form fields based on the loaded schema.
    - [ ] Subtask 1.4: Ensure the form is displayed correctly and is ready for user input.
- [ ] **Task 2:** Write unit tests for the Form Service schema loading and form rendering.
- [ ] **Task 3:** Write integration tests for the Streamlit app initialization and form display.
