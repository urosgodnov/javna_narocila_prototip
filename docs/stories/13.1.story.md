# Story: 13.1 - Implement Password Protection for Template Administration

## Status: Draft

## Story
As an administrator, I want the "Administracija predlog" section to be protected by a password, so that only authorized users can access and manage templates.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  When navigating to "Administracija predlog", a password input field is displayed.
2.  The "Administracija predlog" content is hidden until the correct password is entered.
3.  Upon entering the correct password, the administrator gains access to the Template Administration section.
4.  Upon entering an incorrect password, an error message is displayed, and access is denied.
5.  The password is securely stored (e.g., as an environment variable, not hardcoded).
6.  The application functions correctly after implementing password protection.

## Dev Notes
*   This story will involve modifying `app.py` to add the password input and authentication logic.
*   The password should be stored securely, ideally as an environment variable, to avoid hardcoding.
*   Consider a simple authentication mechanism for this story (e.g., a single hardcoded password for demonstration, to be replaced by a more robust solution in a future security story).
*   The `st.sidebar.radio` logic will need to be updated to incorporate the authentication check.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Task 1 (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6):** Implement password input and authentication logic in `app.py`.
    - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Define a secure way to store the password (e.g., environment variable).
    - [ ] Subtask 1.2: Add a password input field (`st.text_input` with `type="password"`) in the "Administracija predlog" section.
    - [ ] Subtask 1.3: Implement logic to check the entered password against the stored password.
    - [ ] Subtask 1.4: Display the Template Administration content only if the password is correct.
    - [ ] Subtask 1.5: Display an error message for incorrect password attempts.
- [ ] **Task 2 (AC: 6):** Update integration tests (`tests/test_app_integration.py`) to verify password protection functionality.
- [ ] **Task 3 (AC: 6):** Update end-to-end tests (`tests/test_e2e.py`) to verify access control for the Template Administration section.
