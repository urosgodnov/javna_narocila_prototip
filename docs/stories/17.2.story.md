Status: Ready for Review
---

### Story

As a user filling out public procurement documentation, I want an improved, more intuitive form interface with proper Slovenian language and logical step progression, so that I can complete the form efficiently without confusion or fatigue.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. **Visual Design Enhancement**: The form must have a modern, clean visual design with improved spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy.
2. **Complete Slovenian Localization**: All user-facing text, labels, messages, tooltips, and validation errors must be properly translated to Slovenian.
3. **Optimized Step Structure**: The current 10-step form must be analyzed and reorganized to ensure no step is overwhelming - maximum 6-8 form elements per screen.
4. **Enhanced Progress Indication**: Users must have clear visual feedback about their progress through the form with an improved progress bar and step indicators.
5. **Improved Navigation**: Navigation buttons must be consistently styled with clear Slovenian labels and intuitive placement.
6. **Field Layout Optimization**: Form fields must be logically grouped, properly spaced, and use appropriate Streamlit components for better usability.
7. **Slovenian Validation**: All form validation messages and error states must be displayed in proper Slovenian language.
8. **Responsive Design**: The form must work well across different screen sizes and maintain readability.

### Dev Notes

- **Primary Focus**: User experience improvement through better visual design, proper Slovenian localization, and optimized step structure
- **Current Issues**: 10-step form may be overwhelming, mixed English/Slovenian text, basic styling, limited progress feedback
- **Architecture**: Maintain current schema-driven approach while enhancing UI components and adding localization layer
- **Styling**: Use Streamlit's custom CSS capabilities and st.markdown for enhanced styling
- **Performance**: Ensure form responsiveness is not impacted by visual enhancements

### Technical Considerations

- **Streamlit Limitations**: Work within Streamlit's component constraints while maximizing visual appeal
- **State Management**: Ensure enhanced UI doesn't break existing session state management
- **Schema Compatibility**: Maintain full compatibility with existing `SEZNAM_POTREBNIH_PODATKOV.json`
- **Browser Support**: Ensure custom CSS works across major browsers
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Test and optimize for tablet and mobile devices

### Testing

- **Usability Testing**: Verify improved user flow reduces completion time and errors
- **Language Testing**: Native Slovenian speakers should verify translation accuracy and naturalness
- **Cross-browser Testing**: Ensure consistent appearance across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Device Testing**: Test on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Accessibility Testing**: Verify form works with screen readers and keyboard navigation
- **Performance Testing**: Ensure visual enhancements don't significantly impact load times

### Localization Requirements

All text elements must be translated to proper Slovenian including:
- Page titles and headers
- Form field labels and placeholders
- Navigation buttons and links
- Validation error messages
- Help text and tooltips
- Success and confirmation messages
- Progress indicators and status text
- Section headers and descriptions
