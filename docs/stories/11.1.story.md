# Story: 11.1 - Implement Draft Save/Retrieve Functionality

## Status: Done

## Story
As a user, I want to save my current form data as a draft and load previously saved drafts, so that I can continue working on procurement documentation without losing progress.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  A "Save Draft" button is present on the form.
2.  Clicking "Save Draft" stores the current form data in SQLite.
3.  A mechanism (e.g., a dropdown or list) is available to select and load previously saved drafts.
4.  Loading a draft populates the form fields with the saved data.
5.  The application handles cases where no drafts are available.
6.  The form continues to function correctly after saving or loading drafts.

## Dev Notes
*   This story involves implementing the persistence layer using SQLite as described in the architecture.
*   The `Form Service` will be responsible for managing draft save/retrieve operations through SQLite.
*   Consider using a simple SQLite database file (e.g., `drafts.db`) for storing JSON blobs of form data.
*   The `app.py` will need modifications to include the save/load UI elements and logic.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Task 1 (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6):** Implement SQLite database setup and basic CRUD operations for drafts.
    - [x] Subtask 1.1: Create a SQLite database file (e.g., `drafts.db`).
    - [x] Subtask 1.2: Define a table structure to store draft data (e.g., `id`, `timestamp`, `form_data_json`).
    - [x] Subtask 1.3: Implement a function to save form data as a new draft.
    - [x] Subtask 1.4: Implement a function to retrieve all saved draft metadata (e.g., `id`, `timestamp`).
    - [x] Subtask 1.5: Implement a function to load a specific draft by ID.
- [x] **Task 2 (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6):** Integrate save/retrieve functionality into `app.py`.
    - [x] Subtask 2.1: Add a "Save Draft" button to the Streamlit form.
    - [x] Subtask 2.2: Implement the callback for "Save Draft" to call the save function.
    - [x] Subtask 2.3: Add a UI element (e.g., `st.selectbox`) to display available drafts.
    - [x] Subtask 2.4: Implement the callback for selecting a draft to load its data into the form.
    - [x] Subtask 2.5: Handle the display of messages for successful save/load or no drafts found.
- [x] **Task 3:** Update unit tests (`tests/test_form_service.py`) to cover save/retrieve logic.
- [x] **Task 4:** Update integration tests (`tests/test_app_integration.py`) to verify save/retrieve UI and functionality.
- [x] **Task 5:** Update end-to-end tests (`tests/test_e2e.py`) to verify saving a draft and loading it successfully.

## QA Results

### Review Summary

The implementation of draft save/retrieve functionality is well-executed. The new `database.py` module correctly encapsulates SQLite operations, and `app.py` effectively integrates the save/load UI and logic. Test coverage is comprehensive, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests, which all passed successfully.

### Acceptance Criteria Verification

- **AC 1 (Save Draft button present):** PASS
- **AC 2 (Save Draft stores data in SQLite):** PASS
- **AC 3 (Mechanism to select/load drafts available):** PASS
- **AC 4 (Loading draft populates fields):** PASS
- **AC 5 (Handles no drafts available):** PASS
- **AC 6 (Form functions correctly after save/load):** PASS

### Overall Assessment

The story is complete and meets all acceptance criteria. The code is clean, well-tested, and adheres to good practices. Ready for final approval.
