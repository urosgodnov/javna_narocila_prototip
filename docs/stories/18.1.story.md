# Story: Add Organization to Admin Module

**As a** system administrator,
**I want to** be able to add new organizations to the system through the administration module,
**so that** I can manage the list of available organizations for new users.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   An "Add Organization" button is available in the administration module.
*   Clicking the "Add Organization" button opens a form to enter the new organization's details.
*   For now, the form should be a placeholder that adds a "demo" organization to the list of organizations.
*   The new organization ("demo") should be visible in the list of organizations after being added.

## Tasks

*   Create a new "Add Organization" button in the admin module.
*   Implement a placeholder form that is displayed when the button is clicked.
*   The form submission should add a "demo" organization to the system.
*   Display the list of organizations in the admin module, including the newly added "demo" organization.

## Definition of Done

*   The "demo" organization can be successfully added to the system through the admin module.
*   The updated list of organizations is displayed correctly.
*   The code is reviewed and follows the project's coding standards.
*   Unit tests are created for the new functionality.
