# Story: Implement Primary Keys for Organizations and Link Public Procurements

**As a** system administrator,
**I want to** manage organizations with unique identifiers and link public procurements to specific organizations,
**so that** data integrity is maintained and procurements can be properly attributed.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   Organizations stored in `organizations.json` now include a unique primary key (e.g., `org_id`).
*   When adding a new organization, a unique `org_id` is automatically generated and assigned.
*   Public procurements (javna naroƒçila) now have a field to store the `org_id` of the associated organization.
*   For newly created public procurements, the `org_id` is set to the ID of the "demo_organizacije" by default.
*   The system handles the transition of existing "demo" organizations to "demo_organizacije" with a generated ID.

## Tasks

*   Update `organizations.json` schema to include `org_id` for each organization.
*   Modify the organization creation logic in `ui/admin_panel.py` to generate and assign unique `org_id`s.
*   Update the public procurement data structure (e.g., in `SEZNAM_POTREBNIH_PODATKOV.json` or relevant database schema) to include an `organization_id` field.
*   Implement logic to default the `organization_id` for new public procurements to the `org_id` of "demo_organizacije".
*   Consider a migration strategy for existing "demo" organizations if necessary.

## Definition of Done

*   All organizations have unique primary keys.
*   Public procurements are successfully linked to organizations via `org_id`.
*   New public procurements default to "demo_organizacije" ID.
*   Data integrity is maintained across organization and procurement data.
*   Unit tests are updated/created for the new ID generation and linking logic.
*   The code is reviewed and follows the project's coding standards.
