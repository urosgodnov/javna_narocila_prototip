# Story: 5.1 - Deployment Topology

## Status: Done

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

Gemini

### Debug Log References

- Reviewed architecture.md and confirmed it meets story requirements.

### Completion Notes List

- Story 5.1 involved reviewing the existing architecture documentation regarding deployment topology. No code changes were required as the documentation was found to be clear, concise, and complete as per the acceptance criteria.

### File List

- docs/architecture.md (reviewed)

### Change Log

- 2025-08-02: Completed review of deployment topology documentation. Marked tasks as complete and story as 'Done'.

## Story

As a developer, I want to understand the deployment topology so that I can deploy and maintain the application effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  The documentation clearly outlines the deployment topology for the MVP.
2.  The documentation describes the future plans for the deployment topology.
3.  The documentation is easy to understand for new developers.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- The system is a single Streamlit application with all components running in-process. [Source: docs/stories/1.1.story.md]
- The system is composed of several services that interact with each other to generate the final documentation. [Source: docs/stories/2.1.story.md]
- The data flows through the system in a specific sequence, starting with form initialization and ending with the user downloading the generated documentation. [Source: docs/stories/3.1.story.md]
- The different modules in the system interact with each other through in-process function calls and Streamlit callbacks. [Source: docs/stories/4.1.story.md]

### Data Models

No specific guidance found in architecture docs.

### API Specifications

No specific guidance found in architecture docs.

### Component Specifications

- **MVP (Single Container)**:
  - One container hosts the Streamlit app, SQLite file, and ChromaDB instance (Docker Compose or single image).
  - Environment variables configure OpenAI API key and ChromaDB endpoint.
  [Source: docs/architecture.md#5-deployment-topology]

- **Future (Microservices)**:
  - Split services into microservices behind an API gateway.
  - Migrate SQLite to PostgreSQL; use managed ChromaDB.
  - Scale AI Generation via serverless functions.

### File Locations

No specific guidance found in architecture docs.

### Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: Each service should have unit tests to verify its functionality in isolation.
- **Integration Tests**: Integration tests should be written to verify that the services work together as expected.
- **End-to-End Tests**: End-to-end tests should be written to verify that the entire system works as expected from the user's perspective.

### Technical Constraints

- All components run in-process within a single Streamlit app. [Source: docs/architecture.md#1-architecture-overview]

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1 (AC: 1, 2, 3):** Review the deployment topology documentation to ensure it is clear, concise, and complete.
    - [x] Subtask 1.1: Verify that the documentation accurately reflects the current state of the system.
    - [x] Subtask 1.2: Identify any areas of the documentation that are unclear or could be improved.
    - [x] Subtask 1.3: Make any necessary updates to the documentation.
