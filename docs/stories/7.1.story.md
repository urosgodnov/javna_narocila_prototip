# Story: 7.1 - Scalability & Extensibility

## Status: Done

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

Gemini

### Debug Log References

- Reviewed architecture.md and confirmed it meets story requirements.

### Completion Notes List

- Story 7.1 involved reviewing the existing architecture documentation regarding scalability and extensibility. No code changes were required as the documentation was found to be clear, concise, and complete as per the acceptance criteria.

### File List

- docs/architecture.md (reviewed)

### Change Log

- 2025-08-02: Completed review of scalability and extensibility documentation. Marked tasks as complete and story as 'Done'.

## Story

As a developer, I want to understand the scalability and extensibility of the system so that I can make informed decisions about how to add new features and scale the application.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  The documentation clearly outlines the scalability and extensibility of the system.
2.  The documentation describes how the persistence layer can be swapped.
3.  The documentation describes how the vector store can be migrated.
4.  The documentation describes how the modular design facilitates future extraction.
5.  The documentation describes how logging hooks are added to each service.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- The system is a single Streamlit application with all components running in-process. [Source: docs/stories/1.1.story.md]
- The system is composed of several services that interact with each other to generate the final documentation. [Source: docs/stories/2.1.story.md]
- The data flows through the system in a specific sequence, starting with form initialization and ending with the user downloading the generated documentation. [Source: docs/stories/3.1.story.md]
- The different modules in the system interact with each other through in-process function calls and Streamlit callbacks. [Source: docs/stories/4.1.story.md]
- The application is deployed as a single container for the MVP. [Source: docs/stories/5.1.story.md]
- The application has security and compliance measures in place, such as HTTPS, secrets management, input validation, and role separation. [Source: docs/stories/6.1.story.md]

### Data Models

No specific guidance found in architecture docs.

### API Specifications

No specific guidance found in architecture docs.

### Component Specifications

- **Abstracted persistence layer** allows swapping SQLite for a full RDBMS. [Source: docs/architecture.md#7-scalability--extensibility]
- **ChromaDB client** abstraction for migrating vector stores. [Source: docs/architecture.md#7-scalability--extensibility]
- **Modular design**: each service is in its own Python module, facilitating future extraction. [Source: docs/architecture.md#7-scalability--extensibility]
- **Logging hooks** added to each service for tracing and monitoring. [Source: docs/architecture.md#7-scalability--extensibility]

### File Locations

No specific guidance found in architecture docs.

### Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: Each service should have unit tests to verify its functionality in isolation.
- **Integration Tests**: Integration tests should be written to verify that the services work together as expected.
- **End-to-End Tests**: End-to-end tests should be written to verify that the entire system works as expected from the user's perspective.

### Technical Constraints

- All components run in-process within a single Streamlit app. [Source: docs/architecture.md#1-architecture-overview]

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1 (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5):** Review the scalability and extensibility documentation to ensure it is clear, concise, and complete.
    - [x] Subtask 1.1: Verify that the documentation accurately reflects the current state of the system.
    - [x] Subtask 1.2: Identify any areas of the documentation that are unclear or could be improved.
    - [x] Subtask 1.3: Make any necessary updates to the documentation.
