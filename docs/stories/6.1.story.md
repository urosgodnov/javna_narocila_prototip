3.  The documentation describes how user input is validated.
4.  The documentation describes how role separation is achieved.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- The system is a single Streamlit application with all components running in-process. [Source: docs/stories/1.1.story.md]
- The system is composed of several services that interact with each other to generate the final documentation. [Source: docs/stories/2.1.story.md]
- The data flows through the system in a specific sequence, starting with form initialization and ending with the user downloading the generated documentation. [Source: docs/stories/3.1.story.md]
- The different modules in the system interact with each other through in-process function calls and Streamlit callbacks. [Source: docs/stories/4.1.story.md]
- The application is deployed as a single container for the MVP. [Source: docs/stories/5.1.story.md]

### Component Specifications

- **HTTPS** for browser-to-app traffic. [Source: docs/architecture.md#6-security--compliance]
- **Secrets** stored as environment variables. [Source: docs/architecture.md#6-security--compliance]
- **Input validation** in Form Service to prevent injection. [Source: docs/architecture.md#6-security--compliance]
- **Role separation**: admin UI protected by a secret URL or token. [Source: docs/architecture.md#6-security--compliance]

### File Locations

No specific guidance found in architecture docs.

### Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: Each service should have unit tests to verify its functionality in isolation.
- **Integration Tests**: Integration tests should be written to verify that the services work together as expected.
- **End-to-End Tests**: End-to-end tests should be written to verify that the entire system works as expected from the user's perspective.

### Technical Constraints

- All components run in-process within a single Streamlit app. [Source: docs/architecture.md#1-architecture-overview]
