## Status: Done

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

Gemini

### Debug Log References

- Reviewed architecture.md and confirmed it meets story requirements.

### Completion Notes List

- Story 1.1 involved reviewing the existing architecture documentation. No code changes were required as the documentation was found to be clear, concise, and complete as per the acceptance criteria.

### File List

- docs/architecture.md (reviewed)

### Change Log

- 2025-08-02: Completed review of architecture documentation. Marked tasks as complete and story as 'Done'.

## Story

As a developer, I want to understand the high-level system architecture so that I can make informed decisions about where to implement new features and how to maintain the existing codebase.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  The architecture is clearly documented in a single, accessible file.
2.  The documentation outlines the major components of the system.
3.  The documentation describes the interactions between the components.
4.  The documentation is written in a way that is easy for new developers to understand.

### API Specifications

No specific guidance found in architecture docs.

### Component Specifications

- **Streamlit App**: Single-page application that hosts both user and admin interfaces; leverages Streamlit callbacks to invoke services directly. [Source: docs/architecture.md#2-context--components]
- **Form Service**: On startup, loads a fixed JSON schema parsed from `SEZNAM POTREBNIH_PODATKOV.docx`. Renders a static form with predetermined fields. Manages draft save/retrieve operations through SQLite. [Source: docs/architecture.md#2-context--components]
- **Template Admin Service**: Administrator-only module for managing Word templates and database operations. Parses `.docx` templates via `python-docx` and exposes controls to view/overwrite templates, clear or back up SQLite drafts, and manage ChromaDB collections. [Source: docs/architecture.md#2-context--components]
- **Semantic Retrieval Service**: Generates embeddings for historical contracts and stores them in ChromaDB. Provides a function to retrieve top-k similar contract snippets for prompt enrichment. [Source: docs/architecture.md#2-context--components]
- **AI Generation Service**: Composes prompts using a fixed system prompt, user form data, and retrieved context, and calls the LLM (via OpenAI) to generate narrative text. [Source: docs/architecture.md#2-context--components]
- **Document Assembly Service**: Uses `python-docx` to merge field values and AI-generated narratives into template documents and then packages them into a ZIP in-memory. [Source: docs/architecture.md#2-context--components]
- **Download Module**: Utilizes Streamlitâ€™s `st.download_button` to serve the generated ZIP to end users for direct download. [Source: docs/architecture.md#2-context--components]
- **SQLite (Drafts)**: Persists user draft data (JSON blobs) for retrieval across sessions. [Source: docs/architecture.md#2-context--components]
- **ChromaDB**: Stores vector embeddings for semantic search of past contracts. [Source: docs/architecture.md#2-context--components]

### File Locations

No specific guidance found in architecture docs.

### Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: Each service should have unit tests to verify its functionality in isolation.
- **Integration Tests**: Integration tests should be written to verify that the services work together as expected.
- **End-to-End Tests**: End-to-end tests should be written to verify that the entire system works as expected from the user's perspective.

### Technical Constraints

- All components run in-process within a single Streamlit app. [Source: docs/architecture.md#1-architecture-overview]

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1 (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4):** Review the architecture documentation to ensure it is clear, concise, and complete.
    - [x] Subtask 1.1: Verify that the documentation accurately reflects the current state of the system.
    - [x] Subtask 1.2: Identify any areas of the documentation that are unclear or could be improved.
    - [x] Subtask 1.3: Make any necessary updates to the documentation.
