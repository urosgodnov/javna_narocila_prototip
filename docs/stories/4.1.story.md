## Status: Done

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

Gemini

### Debug Log References

- Reviewed architecture.md and confirmed it meets story requirements.

### Completion Notes List

- Story 4.1 involved reviewing the existing architecture documentation regarding module interactions. No code changes were required as the documentation was found to be clear, concise, and complete as per the acceptance criteria.

### File List

- docs/architecture.md (reviewed)

### Change Log

- 2025-08-02: Completed review of module interactions documentation. Marked tasks as complete and story as 'Done'.

## Story

As a developer, I want to understand how the different modules in the system interact with each other so that I can build and maintain the application effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  The documentation clearly outlines the interactions between the different modules in the system.
2.  The documentation describes the invocation mechanism for each module.
3.  The documentation specifies the technology used by each module.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- The system is a single Streamlit application with all components running in-process. [Source: docs/stories/1.1.story.md]
- The system is composed of several services that interact with each other to generate the final documentation. [Source: docs/stories/2.1.story.md]
- The data flows through the system in a specific sequence, starting with form initialization and ending with the user downloading the generated documentation. [Source: docs/stories/3.1.story.md]

No specific guidance found in architecture docs.

### Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: Each service should have unit tests to verify its functionality in isolation.
- **Integration Tests**: Integration tests should be written to verify that the services work together as expected.
- **End-to-End Tests**: End-to-end tests should be written to verify that the entire system works as expected from the user's perspective.

### Technical Constraints

- All components run in-process within a single Streamlit app. [Source: docs/architecture.md#1-architecture-overview]

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1 (AC: 1, 2, 3):** Review the module interactions documentation to ensure it is clear, concise, and complete.
    - [x] Subtask 1.1: Verify that the documentation accurately reflects the current state of the system.
    - [x] Subtask 1.2: Identify any areas of the documentation that are unclear or could be improved.
    - [x] Subtask 1.3: Make any necessary updates to the documentation.
