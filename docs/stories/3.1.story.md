# Story: 3.1 - Data Flow Sequence

## Status: Done

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

Gemini

### Debug Log References

- Reviewed architecture.md and confirmed it meets story requirements.

### Completion Notes List

- Story 3.1 involved reviewing the existing architecture documentation regarding data flow sequence. No code changes were required as the documentation was found to be clear, concise, and complete as per the acceptance criteria.

### File List

- docs/architecture.md (reviewed)

### Change Log

- 2025-08-02: Completed review of data flow sequence documentation. Marked tasks as complete and story as 'Done'.

## Story

As a developer, I want to understand the data flow sequence so that I can trace the flow of data through the system and debug issues more effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  The documentation clearly outlines the sequence of data flow through the system.
2.  The documentation describes the data transformations that occur at each step.
3.  The documentation is easy to understand for new developers.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- The system is a single Streamlit application with all components running in-process. [Source: docs/stories/1.1.story.md]
- The system is composed of several services that interact with each other to generate the final documentation. [Source: docs/stories/2.1.story.md]

### Data Models

No specific guidance found in architecture docs.

### API Specifications

No specific guidance found in architecture docs.

### Component Specifications

- **Form Initialization**: On app launch, Form Service loads the fixed JSON schema and renders the full set of form fields. [Source: docs/architecture.md#3-data-flow-sequence]
- **Draft Save/Retrieve**: User enters data and clicks “Save Draft”—the Form Service writes to SQLite. Selecting a draft loads its JSON into the form. [Source: docs/architecture.md#3-data-flow-sequence]
- **Context Retrieval**: When the user requests AI text, Semantic Retrieval Service queries ChromaDB for relevant contract excerpts. [Source: docs/architecture.md#3-data-flow-sequence]
- **AI Generation**: AI Generation Service builds a prompt (fixed system prompt + form data + context) and calls the LLM API to receive narrative text. [Source: docs/architecture.md#3-data-flow-sequence]
- **Document Assembly**: Document Assembly Service merges data and narratives into `.docx` templates and packages them into an in-memory ZIP. [Source: docs/architecture.md#3-data-flow-sequence]
- **Download Trigger**: Download Module uses `st.download_button` to serve the in-memory ZIP for user download. [Source: docs/architecture.md#3-data-flow-sequence]

### File Locations

No specific guidance found in architecture docs.

### Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: Each service should have unit tests to verify its functionality in isolation.
- **Integration Tests**: Integration tests should be written to verify that the services work together as expected.
- **End-to-End Tests**: End-to-end tests should be written to verify that the entire system works as expected from the user's perspective.

### Technical Constraints

- All components run in-process within a single Streamlit app. [Source: docs/architecture.md#1-architecture-overview]

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1 (AC: 1, 2, 3):** Review the data flow sequence documentation to ensure it is clear, concise, and complete.
    - [x] Subtask 1.1: Verify that the documentation accurately reflects the current state of the system.
    - [x] Subtask 1.2: Identify any areas of the documentation that are unclear or could be improved.
    - [x] Subtask 1.3: Make any necessary updates to the documentation.
